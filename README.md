# EmailSenderViaSendGrid
This is a NodeJS App which helps you send emails using Sendgrid api.

Features:
1. Emails are sent through a secured relay and not any in-built language functions like pHp.
2. Gmail level security and managed by a reputed company, Twilio.
3. Email are sent at 100% rate. Which means your emails will not get stuck or filtered as spam.

What makes this application unique?
-> The other free emailers are not at all secure and are everytime filtered as spam by email service providers like Gmail. Using Sendgrid api ensures that the emails will not be considered spam because they are sent through secured relay and the domain is recognized by every email service provider. 

It is used by most emerging companies as there are not a lot of services like this and others charge a lot of money giving a lower level of security than Sendgrid.
